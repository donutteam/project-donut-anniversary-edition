# Project Donut: Anniversary Edition
Project Donut: Anniversary Edition, for The Simpsons: Hit & Run, is an enhanced version of the original Project Donut Mod from 2013.

Project Donut is also known as the original Donut Mod and this release contains various new features, bug fixes and improvements over this original version.

We created this mod to commemorate our 10th anniversary as a modding team.

## Features
This mod features the following content:

- All Missions from Project Donut
	- Now with Two Difficulty Options
		- Easy: A slightly toned down take on our original go at mission design.
		- Hard: The original difficulty, more or less.
	- Some missions feature special vehicles from later versions of Donut Mod.
- Customisable Hit & Run Chases
	- Choose which car chases you, how fast they are and how many of them!
	- Car options include the previously unused Hijacked Alien Police Car!
- Customisable Level Theme
	- Defaults to the Project Donut Autumn theme.
	- Radical's Original Theme as well as the Autumn and Winter themes from Donut Mod 3 are also available!
- Customisable User Interface
	- Control exactly how covered the Hit & Run meter is.
	- Choose your favorite radar color!
- Returning Favorites
	- Now featuring some staff favorite cars and outfits from later Donut Mod versions.
- New Collectible Locations
	- Same Old Collector Cards, New Locations
	- All New Wasp Camera Locations (with optional shields!)
- And much more!
	- 3D Phone Booth Integration
	- Much Better Source Code
	- New Icon
	- New License Screen
	- Secret Characters (can you find us all?)

All of this comes in at just over 8 megabytes, a little over half the file size of the original mod, despite the new content.

This reduction is achieved mostly by using [LuaP3DLib](https://github.com/hampo/luap3dlib) to load and dynamically modify files from the base game instead of shipping loads of unchanged data.
